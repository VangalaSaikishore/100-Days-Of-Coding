====>Solution: Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented by using GUI Concept. 

====>Basic Information Regarding The Concept:

1>GUI stands for Graphical User Interface. It refers to an interface that allows one to interact with electronic devices like computers tablets through graphic elements.

====>Explanation:
Create an Online Voting System in Java
The project uses Java Swing and the package is imported as:

import javax.swing.*;
The various components of Swing used in the project are jButton, jRadioButton, jTextField, jLabel, JOptionPane and jFrame.

****methods used:
1>add(Component c) : adds component to container.
2>addActionListenerListener(ActionListener d) : add actionListener for specified component
3>setSize(int a, int b) : sets the size of container to specified dimensions.
4>setText(String s) : sets the text of the label to s.
5>getText() : returns the text of the label
6>The  Check Results jButton opens another JOptionPane to show the number of votes the parties have received and also the party having the maximum number of votes.


==>Basic Components of a GUI:
1>Pointer: It is a symbol that appears on the display screen. It can be moved to select commands and objects.
2>Pointing device: It allows you move the pointer and select objects on the screen, e.g. mouse or trackball.
3>Icons: It refers to small images on the display screen that represent commands, files, windows etc. Using pointer and pointing device, you can execute these commands.
4>Desktop: It is the display screen that contains the icons.
