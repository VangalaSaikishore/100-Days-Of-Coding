====>Todays problem: Implementing The Java Program of Implementing Sample Text Editor Using Swings

====>Solution: Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented by using Swings Concept.

====>Basic Information Regarding The Concept:

1>To create a simple text editor in Java Swing we will use a JTextArea, a JMenuBar and add JMenu to it and we will add JMenuItems.
2>All the menu items will have actionListener to detect any action.
3>The javax.swing package provides classes for java swing API such as JButton, JTextField, JTextArea, JRadioButton, JCheckbox, JMenu, JColorChooser etc.


***Methods
1>cut()	removes the selected area from the text area and store it in clipboard
2>copy() copies the selected area from the text area and store it in clipboard
3>paste()	removes the selected area from the text area and store it in clipboard
4>print()	prints the components of the text area

====>Explanation:
There will be a menu bar and it will contain two menus and a button:

1>File menu
open: this menuitem is used to open a file
save: this menuitem is used to save a file
print : this menuitem is used to print the components of the text area
new : this menuitem is used to create a new blank file

2>Edit menu
cut: this menuitem is to cut the selected area and copy it to clipboard
copy: this menuitem is to copy the selected area to the clipboard
paste : this menuitem is to paste the text from the clipboard to the text area

3>Close : this button closes the frame
