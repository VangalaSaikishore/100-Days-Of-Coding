====>Todays problem: Implementing The Java Program of Linked List Using Collection Frameworks

====>Solution: Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented by using Collection Frameworks Concept. 

====>Basic Information Regarding The Concept:

*Java LinkedList class uses a doubly linked list to store the elements. 
**It provides a linked-list data structure. It inherits the AbstractList class and implements List and Deque interfaces.

===>The important points about Java LinkedList are:

<*>     Java LinkedList class can contain duplicate elements.
<**>    Java LinkedList class maintains insertion order.
<***>   Java LinkedList class is non synchronized.
<****>  In Java LinkedList class, manipulation is fast because no shifting needs to occur.
<*****> Java LinkedList class can be used as a list, stack or queue.

====>Explanation:
1>Firstly create a class And Inside the main method we need to create a collection for array.
2>Now we need to add the elements in the list According to the code
3>Here In these program we have added Names called Ravi,vijay,Ravi,Ajay,Pavan,Aditya,Krishna Initially.
4>Then we have printed the list accordingly, Later we have changed the element from the Linked list
5>Now we have removed vijay from the list here we had preformed remove operation
6>Later we have printed the list after preforming the remove operation.

====>Test Cases:
1>Follow the syntax appropriately 
 LinkedList<String> ll=new LinkedList<String>();
 
====>Sample Input And Output:

Ravi
vijay
Ravi
Ajay
pavan
Aditya
Krishna
<<==Removing vijay from LL==>>
<<==After removing the vijay==>>[Ravi, Ravi, Ajay, pavan, Aditya, Krishna]
