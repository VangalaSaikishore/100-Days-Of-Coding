====>Todays problem: Implementing The Java Program of Calculator Using GUI

====>Solution: Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented by using GUI Concept. 

====>Basic Information Regarding The Concept:

1>GUI stands for Graphical User Interface. It refers to an interface that allows one to interact with electronic devices like computers tablets through graphic elements.

==>Basic Components of a GUI:

1>Pointer: It is a symbol that appears on the display screen. It can be moved to select commands and objects.
2>Pointing device: It allows you move the pointer and select objects on the screen, e.g. mouse or trackball.
3>Icons: It refers to small images on the display screen that represent commands, files, windows etc. Using pointer and pointing device, you can execute these commands.
4>Desktop: It is the display screen that contains the icons.

====>Explanation:
1>The process of creating a GUI in Swing starts with creating a class that represents the main GUI. 
2>Swing and JavaFX are two commonly used applications to create GUIs in Java.

****methods used:
1>add(Component c) : adds component to container.
2>addActionListenerListener(ActionListener d) : add actionListener for specified component
3>setBackground(Color c) : sets the background color of the specified container
4>setSize(int a, int b) : sets the size of container to specified dimensions.
5>setText(String s) : sets the text of the label to s.
6>getText() : returns the text of the label
