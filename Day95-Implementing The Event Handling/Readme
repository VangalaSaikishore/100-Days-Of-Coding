====>Todays problem: Implementing The Java Program to the Convertion of Temperature from Farenheit And Celsius Using Event Handling

====>Solution: Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented by using Event Handling Concept. 

====>Basic Information Regarding The Concept:

1>In Java, an event is an object which specifies the change of state in the source. 
2>It is generated whenever an action takes place like a mouse button is clicked or text is modified. 
3>Javaâ€™s AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)  is responsible for communicating these actions between the program and the user.
4>Java packages such as java. util, java. awt, java. awt. event and javax. swing support event handling mechanism.

====>Explanation:

Event and Listener (Java Event Handling) :
==>Changing the state of an object is known as an event. 
==>For example, click on button, dragging mouse etc. 
==>The java.awt.event package provides many event classes and Listener interfaces for event handling.
