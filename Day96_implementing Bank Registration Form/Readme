====>Todays problem: Implementing The Java Program to Bank Registration form Using Event Handling

====>Solution: Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented by using Event Handling Concept. 

====>Basic Information Regarding The Concept:

1>In Java, an event is an object which specifies the change of state in the source. 
2>It is generated whenever an action takes place like a mouse button is clicked or text is modified. 
3>Java’s AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)  is responsible for communicating these actions between the program and the user.
4>Java packages such as java. util, java. awt, java. awt. event and javax. swing support event handling mechanism.

====>Explanation:

==>Event:
1>When you press a button in your program or Android application the state of the button changes from ‘Unclicked’ to ‘Clicked’
2>This change in the state of our button is called an Event. Events are generated based on how you interact with the GUI

==>Source:
1>The button you press is an object too. Sorce is the object which generates an event. In other words, a source is an object which undergoes state change.
2>It also provides information about the event to the listener. We will talk about the listener in the other half of this post.

==>Listeners:
1>Listeners are also called as event handlers as they are the ones responsible to handle events occurring at the source.
2>Listeners are interfaces and different types of listeners are used according to the event.

<==>Event and Listener (Java Event Handling) :
==>Changing the state of an object is known as an event. 
==>For example, click on button, dragging mouse etc. 
==>The java.awt.event package provides many event classes and Listener interfaces for event handling.

1>Here, By using Java Swings package, i have created the required objects like frame, text fiels, buttons, radio buttons, scroll pane etc.
2>Then I have registered the buttons with ActionListener and also the frame objects implements the ActionListener interface.
3>Later if the all details required in Bank registration form are filled, then after clicking submit button, then those are set to one Text Field with correponding text label.
4>Then reset button is pressed, the entered information is cleared and again new form is generated.
