====>Todays problem: Implementing The Java Program of JTable Using Java Swings

====>Solution: Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented by using Swings Concept. 

====>Basic Information Regarding The Concept:

*The JTable class is a part of Java Swing Package and is generally used to display or edit two-dimensional data that is having both rows and columns.
**It is similar to a spreadsheet. This arranges data in a tabular form.

====>Explanation:
*The JTable class is used to display data in tabular form. It is composed of rows and columns.

==>Functions in JTable: 

1>addColumn(TableColumn []column) : adds a column at the end of the JTable.
2>clearSelection() : Selects all the selected rows and columns.
3>editCellAt(int row, int col) : edits the intersecting cell of the column number col and row number row programmatically, 
  if the given indices are valid and the corresponding cell is editable.
4>setValueAt(Object value, int row, int col) : Sets the cell value as ‘value’ for the position row, col in the JTable.
