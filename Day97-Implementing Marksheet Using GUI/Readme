====>Todays problem: Implementing The Java Program to Mark sheet form Using GUI

====>Solution: Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented by using GUI Concept. 

====>Basic Information Regarding The Concept:

1>GUI stands for Graphical User Interface. It refers to an interface that allows one to interact with electronic devices like computers tablets through graphic elements.

==>Basic Components of a GUI:

1>Pointer: It is a symbol that appears on the display screen. It can be moved to select commands and objects.
2>Pointing device: It allows you move the pointer and select objects on the screen, e.g. mouse or trackball.
3>Icons: It refers to small images on the display screen that represent commands, files, windows etc. Using pointer and pointing device, you can execute these commands.
4>Desktop: It is the display screen that contains the icons.

====>Explanation:
1>The process of creating a GUI in Swing starts with creating a class that represents the main GUI. 
2>Swing and JavaFX are two commonly used applications to create GUIs in Java.

==>Elements of GUI:
A GUI comprises an array of user interface elements. All these elements are displayed when a user is interacting with an application and they are as follows:
1>Input commands such as buttons, check boxes, dropdown lists and text fields.

2>Informational components like banners, icons, labels or notification dialogs.

3>Navigational units like menus, sidebars and breadcrumbs.

4>As far as JavaFX is concerned, it consists of a totally different set of graphic components along with new features and terminologies.
