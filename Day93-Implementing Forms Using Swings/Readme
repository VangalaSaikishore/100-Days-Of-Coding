====>Todays problem: Implementing The Java Program of Forms Using Java Swings

====>Solution: Here This problem is simple and Here I have Implemented by using Swings Concept. 

====>Basic Information Regarding The Concept:

*Java Swing tutorial is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) that is used to create window-based applications. 
**It is built on the top of AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit) API and entirely written in java.
***Unlike AWT, Java Swing provides platform-independent and lightweight components.
****The javax.swing package provides classes for java swing API such as JButton, JTextField, JTextArea, JRadioButton, JCheckbox, JMenu, JColorChooser etc.

====>Explanation:

Java JFrame
1>The javax.swing.JFrame class is a type of container which inherits the java.awt.Frame class. 
2>JFrame works like the main window where components like labels, buttons, textfields are added to create a GUI.
3>setVisible(boolean val) is used, if it is said to be true, then the frame visible.
4>setSize(int len,int wid) is to set the size of frame
5>setLayout() is used to set the layout for the frame
6>add(obj) is used to add objects to the frame
7>And JLabel is a class of java Swing . JLabel is used to display a short string or an image icon. JLabel can display text, image or both . 
8>JLabel is only a display of text or image and it cannot get focus . JLabel is inactive to input events such a mouse focus or keyboard focus.
